        <h1>The Locals</h1>
            <p>Bletchley was a small town that was used to house the code breaking center [6].
             The population of the city and the surrounding area skyrocketed and forced locals to let people stay with them[8].
            Many people came from other parts of the country to work here [6, pg 36]
            The number of workers went from hundreds to thousands [6, pg 35]
            </p>
        <h1>The Workers</h1>
            <p>While working at Bletchley Park, employees were sworn to secrecy, this is only one of the measures 
            that were put into place to ensure that the operations at Bletchley Park remained hidden. In addition to the 
            role that management played in the maintenance of secrecy, they also played a role in the gender dynamics 
            that existed at Bletchley Park. For a long time, the work of female employees at Bletchley Park was concealed 
            to the public despite their contributions to early computing. </p>
        <h1>Secrecy</h1>
            <p>Arriving in the darkness of nightfall to a location only specified through a telegrammed summons with no indication of what they would be assigned to do there [6, pg. 3], this would serve as a precursor to the secrets hidden away at Bletchley Park for many of those that worked there. During its operation, many forms of social engineering were employed at Bletchley Park. Upon arrival, workers were immediately told to sign the Official Secrets Act in which they would be sworn to secrecy [6]. These measures would be just the beginning of those used by management to uphold the secrets of Bletchley Park. Workers were not allowed to disclose their work with anyone else, not even their families [6]. There was an intense presence of surveillance at every corner. There was also a compartmentalization of operations like those seen in the wartime research grounds of Los Alamos during the building of the atom bomb. An organizational separation was put into place that ensured that many of those that worked there would not actually be aware of what they were creating. Implementing this form of compartmentalization ensured that these secrets would be more easily held as you cannot spill the secrets that you do not know. Even with its closure in 1946, those who worked at Bletchley Park would not be able to discuss their work there until the late 1970s [6] when its operations were declassified. </p>
        <h1>Wrens</h1>
            <p>Those in the Womenâ€™s Royal Naval Service who worked on codebreaking were given the name Wrens. Having only been given the machines these women would go on to contribute to the early developments of programming. With one of the women developing what would become known as break statements, a debugging method still used to this day. Despite their contributions to computing they were not treated the same as their male counterparts at Bletchley Park. They were often regarded as only performing menial tasks requiring little intellectual ability despite their contributions leading to the deciphering of code. This view on their work can be seen as they had to complete military drills at night that the male workers did not have to do. This view of women also meant that they would not be able to move up in the hierarchy and that promotions were not usually given to the women of Bletchley Park. Due to the secrecy that they were upheld, their contributions to the decoding at Bletchley park would remain hidden. Not only would they not be able to disclose their contributions this would also go on to affect their future employment opportunities as they would not be able to discuss the work that they completed with future employers as well. This coupled with the present and conformity to gender norms meant that with the shutdown of Bletchley park in 1946 many of the women who were a part of the first steps to programming would end up leaving the field of computing. This same view of women in computing could be seen at the operations of __ despite the same secrecy not being seen. Maybe they would have the opportunities that they did in __. Their contributions to computing through their involvement with the colossus would help to develop programming and if these women were given the same opportunities as men were to continue on with computing it is difficult to see what they would have been able to achieve. </p>
